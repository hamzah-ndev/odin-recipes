        <br>
        <strong>Seasoning:</strong>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <br>
        <strong>Egg omelette strips:</strong>
        <li>4 large eggs beaten</li>
        <li>⅛ tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <br>
        <strong>Pan-fried peanuts and anchovies:</strong>
        <li>1 cup dry roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>1 cup dried anchovies</li>
        <li>2 tsp cooking oil divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Wash the rice:</strong>
        <br>
        Rinse the rice in several changes of water until the water runs pretty clear. Drain off all water completely.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Cooking the rice:</strong></li>
            <strong>If cooking with Rice Cooker:</strong> Place all the ingredients in the inner pot of the rice cooker. Stir to mix. Close the lid and use the white rice setting or whichever setting you usually use to cook white rice. Wait 10 minutes before opening to fluff the rice. Remove all the herbs and spices and fluff the rice with a rice paddle.
            <br>
            <strong>If cooking with Instant Pot:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Place all ingredients in the inner pot of Instant Pot. Give it a stir and make sure the rice is covered by the liquid. Cover the lid. Turn the pressure release valve to "sealing" and press "pressure cooker" and make sure it's on high pressure. Set the timer to 5 minutes. When it's done cooking, wait 10 minutes before opening the lid to let residual heat continues cooking the rice and the rice can absorb all the liquid. If you open it sooner, the rice might still be wet.</li>
                <li>After 10 minutes, unlock the lid. You may still see that the top of the rice is slightly uncooked and the bottom is slightly wetter than the top, but don't worry, use a rice paddle to fluff the rice to mix everything in. Close the lid back and another 10 minutes, the residual heat will soften the rice and everything will be evenly cooked.</li>
            </ol>
            <strong>If cooking on the stove:</strong> Place all the ingredients in a heavy-bottom pot, except for the rice and let it cook over medium heat until liquid comes to a gentle simmer. Add the rice and stir to mix. Cover with a lid and turn the heat down to low and let it cook for about 5 minutes and stir again to prevent coconut milk catching at the bottom of the pot. Cover the lid back up again and let it cook for another 5 minutes then turn off the heat, but do not open the lid yet, let it sit for 10 minutes before opening. Remove all the herbs and spices and fluff the rice with a rice paddle.
            <br> <br>
        <li><strong>Make the egg omelette strips:</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat the eggs with a fork with seasonings.</li>
                <li>Preheat non-stick pan. When it's hot enough, add cooking oil. Pour the egg mixture onto the middle of the pan and swirl to cover the base of the pan. Let it cook for about 10 seconds. Use a spatula to push the edge and let the runny eggs flow to cover the base of the pan. When the bottom has set, flip over and cook until the other side is set. Remove from the pan.</li>
                <li>Roll it up and cut into strips.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
        <li><strong>Prepare pan-fried peanuts and anchovies:</strong></li>
        Preheat a medium-size pan with 1 tsp cooking oil. Add anchovies and pan fry until crispy. In the same pan, add another 1 tsp of oil. Add the peanuts and cook until the peanuts are lightly brown. Turn off the heat and give it a good stir to mix everything. Remove from the heat.
        <br> <br>
        <li><strong>Serving:</strong></li>
        Serve the warm rice with the omelette strips, few slices of cucumber, pan-fried peanuts and anchovies, mie goreng, and sambal.
