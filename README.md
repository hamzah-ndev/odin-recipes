I feel that the approach adopted by The Odin Project is very suitable for me who is just about to enter the world of professional developers. With a brief and applicable explanation, I can quickly understand the basic operations of git. I feel this is very important to me. Building a simple project, which can then be immediately live-in, really provides a very impressive learning experience for me.
Thank you, The Odin Project.
