I feel that the approach adopted by The Odin Project is very suitable for me who is just about to enter the world of professional developers.

With a brief and practical explanation, I can quickly understand the basic operations of git. The links that are included as supplementary material to understand the subject more broadly and in depth, are really very useful. I feel that this is very important to me.

The Odin Project teaches me how important it is to have a proper commit message.

Building a simple project, which can then be immediately live-in, really provides a very impressive learning experience for me.

As a new github user, I would be very grateful to anyone who would be willing to provide an evaluation of my activity.

Thank you, The Odin Project.
